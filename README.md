## About

A Bun application that connects to a MongoDB database and serves a React client. All of this runs inside a Docker container, so you don't need anything installed except, of course, Docker and Docker-compose.

## Get started

Clone the repository and run the following command inside:

```zsh
docker-compose up --build
```

The app will run on localhost:3000
